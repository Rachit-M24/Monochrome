# It is a weather forecast web that gives nearly 98% accurate weather reports and data
why don't you see for yourself?
let me help you with that in case you are new to this 

for trying out it locally on your laptop or computer.

# Download all files and folders  then extract the zip file after that the game begins.

## First open an IDE whichever you are comfortable with then open a terminal in it and type these commands
   Note: you should  have node installed on your laptop/PC
   
```
npm create vite@latest 
```
after that you can install the tailwind in your vite react app otherwise you can add tailwindcss CDN link in your index.html file

  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```
